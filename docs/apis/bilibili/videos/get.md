## Paging

One object per call: there is nothing to page.

## When you are charged

| Case | Charged |
| --- | --- |
| A result with data | $0.0020, once per call |
| The object does not exist (404) | not charged |
| Invalid parameters, a failure of ours or of the data source, a timeout | not charged |
| The most one call can cost | $0.0020 (send `X-Max-Price` to refuse anything above your own limit) |

Prices as read 2026-10-18 19:59 UTC, under price book 2, in effect since 2026-10-17 11:00 UTC; the Playground reads the price in force before a run.

## If the object does not exist

The answer is 404 `not_found` and nothing is charged. `reason` says which: `not_found` (it does not exist) or `private_or_deleted`.

## Errors

## Use it in your AI

`dataxapi setup` gives the agents on your machine (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) the DataXAPI MCP server and the base skill. The key is read from DATAXAPI_API_KEY; none is written into a file.

MCP server: `https://api.dataxapi.com/mcp`. The entry for your client is under MCP in the request examples of this page; then ask your agent to call `bilibili.videos.get`.
