## What you get

The first 2 rows of a response recorded 2026-10-12 18:42 UTC.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| rank | 1 |
| heat | 2,038,305 |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `board` | text |  | Which list: hot searches is the only one. Values: `hot_search` (default). Example: `hot_search`. |
| `view` | text |  | How much of each item to return. All three cost the same. Values: `compact`, `standard` (default), `full`. |
| `fields` | list of text |  | Return only these fields. Each by its path, such as `author.name`. |

## Returned fields

`data.items` is a list of trend objects. Stable: fields are only ever added.

Three views: `compact` (the most used fields, long text cut short), `standard` (the default: every standard field) and `full` (adds `ext`, the platform's own fields). A field is in the view named and in every larger one.

| Field | Type | Description | From view | This endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | text | The platform's ID for the entry. | `compact` | The platform has none |
| `name` | text | Name of the entry. | `compact` | Yes |
| `rank` | integer | Position on the board, from 1; a pinned entry has none. | `compact` | Yes |
| `heat` | integer | The platform's heat score. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate` | list of object | Which numbers of this item are approximate or lower bounds; absent when all are exact. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].field` | text | Path of the field, such as metrics.views. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].kind` | text | Approximate, or a lower bound. Values: `approximate`, `lower_bound`. | `compact` | Yes |

A field with no value on an item is `null`. A field this endpoint cannot give is left out and listed in `meta.unavailable`.

Typical size of one item: `compact` 66 B, `standard` 66 B, `full` 66 B (measured on the response recorded 2026-10-12 18:42 UTC).

## Paging

50 items a page. The page size is the platform's; `limit` is not accepted.

Everything comes in one page; no cursor is issued.

Answers come from a shared snapshot refreshed every 10 minutes; `meta.cached` says so and `meta.fetched_at` is when it was taken.

## When you are charged

| Case | Charged |
| --- | --- |
| A result with data | $0.0020, once per call |
| An empty result | $0.0020 |
| Invalid parameters, a failure of ours or of the data source, a timeout | not charged |
| The most one call can cost | $0.0020 (send `X-Max-Price` to refuse anything above your own limit) |

Prices as read 2026-10-18 19:59 UTC, under price book 2, in effect since 2026-10-17 11:00 UTC; the Playground reads the price in force before a run.

## Errors

Every error has the same structure: `code`, `message`, `charged`, `retry`, `retry_after_seconds`, `param`, `docs_url`.

## Use it in your AI

`dataxapi setup` gives the agents on your machine (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) the DataXAPI MCP server and the base skill. The key is read from DATAXAPI_API_KEY; none is written into a file.

MCP server: `https://api.dataxapi.com/mcp`. The entry for your client is under MCP in the request examples of this page; then ask your agent to call `bilibili.trends.list`.
