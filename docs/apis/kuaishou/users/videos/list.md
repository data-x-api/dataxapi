## What you get

The first 7 rows of a response recorded 2026-10-12 19:01 UTC.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| published_at | 2026-10-12 15:12 UTC |
| author.verified | true |

| metrics.comments | 88 |
| metrics.shares | 44 |
| metrics.favorites | 83 |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | text | Yes | User ID, a string of digits (not the handle). Example: `917792206`. |
| `sort` | text |  | Order: newest first, most popular first. Values: `latest` (default), `popular`. Example: `latest`. |
| `cursor` | text |  | Cursor returned by the previous page. Pass `page.next_cursor` of the page before, unchanged. Each page is charged as a call of its own. |
| `view` | text |  | How much of each item to return. All three cost the same. Values: `compact`, `standard` (default), `full`. |
| `fields` | list of text |  | Return only these fields. Each by its path, such as `author.name`. |

## Returned fields

`data.items` is a list of post objects. Stable: fields are only ever added.

Three views: `compact` (the most used fields, long text cut short), `standard` (the default: every standard field) and `full` (adds `ext`, the platform's own fields). A field is in the view named and in every larger one.

| Field | Type | Description | From view | This endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | text | ID; pass it unchanged to the get endpoint. | `compact` | Yes |
| `url` | link | Link that opens the post. | `compact` | Yes |
| `type` | text | Content format. Values: `video`, `image`, `text`, `article`. | `compact` | Not provided here |
| `title` | text | Title. | `compact` | The platform has none |
| `text` | text | Body text. Long text: the compact view keeps the first 500 characters and says so in `warnings`. | `compact` | Yes |
| `lang` | text | Language of the text. | `standard` | Not provided here |
| `published_at` | time | When it was published. | `compact` | Yes |
| `author` | object | Author. | `compact` | Yes |

| `author.verified` | yes/no | Whether the author is verified. | `standard` | Yes |
| `author.followers` | integer | Author's follower count. | `standard` | Not provided here |

| `is_pinned` | yes/no | Whether the author pinned it. | `standard` | Not provided here |
| `post_id` | text | ID of the thread's root post when this is a reply; otherwise null. | `compact` | The platform has none |
| `parent_id` | text | ID of the item it replies to directly; otherwise null. | `compact` | The platform has none |
| `root_id` | text | ID of the first-level reply its thread hangs under. | `compact` | The platform has none |
| `approximate` | list of object | Which numbers of this item are approximate or lower bounds; absent when all are exact. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].field` | text | Path of the field, such as metrics.views. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].kind` | text | Approximate, or a lower bound. Values: `approximate`, `lower_bound`. | `compact` | Yes |

A field with no value on an item is `null`. A field this endpoint cannot give is left out and listed in `meta.unavailable`.

Typical size of one item: `compact` 444 B, `standard` 578 B, `full` 578 B (measured on the response recorded 2026-10-12 19:01 UTC).

## Paging

20 items a page. The page size is the platform's; `limit` is not accepted.

For the next page pass `page.next_cursor` as `cursor`; a cursor is valid for 1 hour. `page.has_more` is false on the last page.

## When you are charged

| Case | Charged |
| --- | --- |
| A result with data | $0.0200, once per call |
| Each further page | charged as a call of its own |
| An empty result | $0.0200 |
| Invalid parameters, a failure of ours or of the data source, a timeout | not charged |
| The most one call can cost | $0.0200 (send `X-Max-Price` to refuse anything above your own limit) |
| With `sort=popular` | $0.0020 per call; at most $0.0020 a call; an empty result $0.0020 |

Prices as read 2026-10-18 19:59 UTC, under price book 2, in effect since 2026-10-17 11:00 UTC; the Playground reads the price in force before a run.

## If the object does not exist

A user that does not exist cannot be told from a user without videos: both return an empty result, not a 404, and are charged as an empty result is.

## Errors

Every error has the same structure: `code`, `message`, `charged`, `retry`, `retry_after_seconds`, `param`, `docs_url`.

## Use it in your AI

`dataxapi setup` gives the agents on your machine (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) the DataXAPI MCP server and the base skill. The key is read from DATAXAPI_API_KEY; none is written into a file.

MCP server: `https://api.dataxapi.com/mcp`. The entry for your client is under MCP in the request examples of this page; then ask your agent to call `kuaishou.users.videos.list`.
