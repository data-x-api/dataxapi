# Xiaohongshu (RedNote) PGY creator search API

Search Xiaohongshu creators on PGY by terms, matched against what they write about: creator ID, name, handle, location, content categories, followers, and in the full view what an image note and a video note cost and median reads and interactions. The creator ID the other PGY endpoints take comes from here. Up to 20 items a call; $0.0400 per call. Errors and timeouts are not charged; an empty result is charged $0.0400.

## What you get

The first row of a response recorded 2026-10-12 21:55 UTC.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| metrics.followers | 30,634 |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | text | Yes | Search terms, matched against what creators' notes are about; for terms no creator matches the platform still returns loosely related creators, not an empty result. Example: `咖啡`. |
| `cursor` | text |  | Cursor returned by the previous page. Pass `page.next_cursor` of the page before, unchanged. Each page is charged as a call of its own. |
| `view` | text |  | How much of each item to return. All three cost the same. Values: `compact`, `standard` (default), `full`. |
| `fields` | list of text |  | Return only these fields. Each by its path, such as `author.name`. |

## Returned fields

`data.items` is a list of creator objects. Preview: the structure may change, announced beforehand.

Three views: `compact` (the most used fields, long text cut short), `standard` (the default: every standard field) and `full` (adds `ext`, the platform's own fields). A field is in the view named and in every larger one.

| Field | Type | Description | From view | This endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | text | The creator's ID in the marketplace. | `compact` | Yes |
| `account_id` | text | ID of the creator's account on the platform, as the platform's account endpoints take it. | `compact` | Yes |
| `username` | text | Handle. | `compact` | Yes |
| `name` | text | Display name. | `compact` | Yes |
| `avatar_url` | link | Avatar. | `standard` | Yes |
| `location` | text | Where the creator is based, in the platform's words. | `standard` | Yes |
| `categories` | list of text | Content categories, first level, in the platform's words. | `compact` | Yes |
| `subcategories` | list of text | Content categories, second level, in the platform's words. | `standard` | Yes |
| `metrics` | object | Creator counts. | `compact` | Yes |
| `metrics.followers` | integer | Followers. | `compact` | Yes |
| `ext.rate_image_note` | amount | Rate for an image note, in yuan. | `full` | Yes |
| `ext.rate_video_note` | amount | Rate for a video note, in yuan. | `full` | Yes |
| `ext.sponsored_notes` | integer | Number of sponsored notes. | `full` | Yes |
| `ext.median_reads` | integer | Median reads of a note. | `full` | Yes |
| `ext.median_engagements` | integer | Median interactions of a note. | `full` | Yes |
| `approximate` | list of object | Which numbers of this item are approximate or lower bounds; absent when all are exact. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].field` | text | Path of the field, such as metrics.views. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].kind` | text | Approximate, or a lower bound. Values: `approximate`, `lower_bound`. | `compact` | Yes |

A field with no value on an item is `null`. A field this endpoint cannot give is left out and listed in `meta.unavailable`.

Typical size of one item: `compact` 186 B, `standard` 379 B, `full` 502 B (measured on the response recorded 2026-10-12 21:55 UTC).

## Paging

20 items a page. The page size is the platform's; `limit` is not accepted.

For the next page pass `page.next_cursor` as `cursor`; a cursor is valid for 1 hour. `page.has_more` is false on the last page.

## When you are charged

| Case | Charged |
| --- | --- |
| A result with data | $0.0400, once per call |
| Each further page | charged as a call of its own |
| An empty result | $0.0400 |
| Invalid parameters, a failure of ours or of the data source, a timeout | not charged |
| The most one call can cost | $0.0400 (send `X-Max-Price` to refuse anything above your own limit) |

Prices as read 2026-10-18 19:59 UTC, under price book 2, in effect since 2026-10-17 11:00 UTC; the Playground reads the price in force before a run.

## Use it in your AI

`dataxapi setup` gives the agents on your machine (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) the DataXAPI MCP server and the base skill. The key is read from DATAXAPI_API_KEY; none is written into a file.

MCP server: `https://api.dataxapi.com/mcp`. The entry for your client is under MCP in the request examples of this page; then ask your agent to call `xiaohongshu.pgy.creators.search`.
