## What you get

The first 3 rows of a response recorded 2026-10-12 19:03 UTC.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| published_at | 2026-10-10 09:19 UTC |
| metrics.likes | 364 |
| metrics.comments | 0 |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | text | Yes | Link to the article: the long link with __biz, mid, idx and sn, or the short /s/ link. Example: `https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MjAxNDM4MA==&mid=2667038683&idx=1&sn=0422127e651acd7f6cf6ef7e1cff04bc`. Full link: `https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MjAxNDM4MA==&mid=2667038683&idx=1&sn=0422127e651acd7f6cf6ef7e1cff04bc`. Short link: `https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TSNQKkRpN1qbKsT7BvzqIw`. The link has to be opened to learn what it points at, so the result cannot be checked against it. |
| `cursor` | text |  | Cursor returned by the previous page. Pass `page.next_cursor` of the page before, unchanged. Each page is charged as a call of its own. |
| `view` | text |  | How much of each item to return. All three cost the same. Values: `compact`, `standard` (default), `full`. |
| `fields` | list of text |  | Return only these fields. Each by its path, such as `author.name`. |

## Returned fields

`data.items` is a list of comment objects. Stable: fields are only ever added.

Three views: `compact` (the most used fields, long text cut short), `standard` (the default: every standard field) and `full` (adds `ext`, the platform's own fields). A field is in the view named and in every larger one.

| Field | Type | Description | From view | This endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | text | ID. | `compact` | Yes |
| `url` | link | Link that opens the comment. | `compact` | The platform has none |
| `text` | text | Text. Long text: the compact view keeps the first 500 characters and says so in `warnings`. | `compact` | Yes |
| `published_at` | time | When it was posted. | `compact` | Yes |
| `author` | object | Commenter. | `compact` | Yes |
| `author.id` | text | Commenter's account ID. | `compact` | Yes |
| `author.username` | text | Commenter's handle. | `compact` | The platform has none |
| `author.name` | text | Commenter's display name. | `compact` | Yes |
| `author.avatar_url` | link | Commenter's avatar. | `standard` | Yes |
| `metrics` | object | Engagement counts. | `compact` | Yes |
| `metrics.likes` | integer | Likes. | `compact` | Yes |
| `metrics.comments` | integer | Replies. | `compact` | Yes |
| `post_id` | text | ID of the post it is under. | `compact` | Not provided here |
| `parent_id` | text | ID of the comment it replies to directly; null for a top-level comment. | `compact` | Yes |
| `root_id` | text | ID of the top-level comment of its thread; null for a top-level comment. | `compact` | Yes |
| `ext.ip_location` | text | IP location as the platform shows it. | `full` | Yes |
| `approximate` | list of object | Which numbers of this item are approximate or lower bounds; absent when all are exact. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].field` | text | Path of the field, such as metrics.views. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].kind` | text | Approximate, or a lower bound. Values: `approximate`, `lower_bound`. | `compact` | Yes |

A field with no value on an item is `null`. A field this endpoint cannot give is left out and listed in `meta.unavailable`.

Typical size of one item: `compact` 252 B, `standard` 426 B, `full` 458 B (measured on the response recorded 2026-10-12 19:03 UTC).

## Paging

20 items a page. The page size is the platform's; `limit` is not accepted.

For the next page pass `page.next_cursor` as `cursor`; a cursor is valid for 1 hour. `page.has_more` is false on the last page.

## When you are charged

| Case | Charged |
| --- | --- |
| A result with data | $0.0200, once per call |
| Each further page | charged as a call of its own |
| An empty result | $0.0200 |
| The object does not exist (404) | not charged |
| Invalid parameters, a failure of ours or of the data source, a timeout | not charged |
| The most one call can cost | $0.0200 (send `X-Max-Price` to refuse anything above your own limit) |

Prices as read 2026-10-18 19:59 UTC, under price book 2, in effect since 2026-10-17 11:00 UTC; the Playground reads the price in force before a run.

## If the object does not exist

The answer is 404 `not_found` and nothing is charged. `reason` says which: `not_found` (it does not exist) or `private_or_deleted`.

## Errors

Every error has the same structure: `code`, `message`, `charged`, `retry`, `retry_after_seconds`, `param`, `docs_url`.

## Use it in your AI

`dataxapi setup` gives the agents on your machine (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) the DataXAPI MCP server and the base skill. The key is read from DATAXAPI_API_KEY; none is written into a file.

MCP server: `https://api.dataxapi.com/mcp`. The entry for your client is under MCP in the request examples of this page; then ask your agent to call `wechat_mp.articles.comments.list`.
