## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | text | Yes | The account's original ID, starting with gh_; an article's author.id is one. Example: `gh_13c97ab93ce8`. |
| `view` | text |  | How much of each item to return. All three cost the same. Values: `compact`, `standard` (default), `full`. |
| `fields` | list of text |  | Return only these fields. Each by its path, such as `author.name`. |

## Returned fields

`data.item` is one account object. Stable: fields are only ever added.

Three views: `compact` (the most used fields, long text cut short), `standard` (the default: every standard field) and `full` (adds `ext`, the platform's own fields). A field is in the view named and in every larger one.

| Field | Type | Description | From view | This endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | text | ID. | `compact` | Yes |
| `username` | text | Handle. | `compact` | Not provided here |
| `name` | text | Display name. | `compact` | Yes |
| `url` | link | Link to the profile. | `compact` | The platform has none |
| `bio` | text | Bio. Long text: the compact view keeps the first 500 characters and says so in `warnings`. | `compact` | Not provided here |
| `avatar_url` | link | Avatar. | `standard` | Not provided here |
| `verified` | yes/no | Whether the account is verified. | `standard` | Not provided here |
| `created_at` | time | When the account was created. | `standard` | Not provided here |
| `metrics` | object | Account counts. | `compact` | Not provided here |
| `metrics.followers` | integer | Followers. | `compact` | Not provided here |
| `metrics.following` | integer | Following. | `compact` | Not provided here |
| `metrics.posts` | integer | Posts published. | `compact` | Not provided here |
| `ext.ip_location` | text | IP location as the platform shows it. | `full` | Yes |
| `ext.original_articles` | integer | Number of original articles. | `full` | Yes |
| `ext.channels_id` | text | ID of the linked Channels account. | `full` | Yes |
| `approximate` | list of object | Which numbers of this item are approximate or lower bounds; absent when all are exact. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].field` | text | Path of the field, such as metrics.views. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].kind` | text | Approximate, or a lower bound. Values: `approximate`, `lower_bound`. | `compact` | Yes |

A field with no value on an item is `null`. A field this endpoint cannot give is left out and listed in `meta.unavailable`.

Typical size of one item: `compact` 48 B, `standard` 48 B, `full` 206 B (measured on the response recorded 2026-10-12 19:02 UTC).

## Paging

One object per call: there is nothing to page.

## When you are charged

| Case | Charged |
| --- | --- |
| A result with data | $0.0200, once per call |
| The object does not exist (404) | not charged |
| Invalid parameters, a failure of ours or of the data source, a timeout | not charged |
| The most one call can cost | $0.0200 (send `X-Max-Price` to refuse anything above your own limit) |

Prices as read 2026-10-18 19:59 UTC, under price book 2, in effect since 2026-10-17 11:00 UTC; the Playground reads the price in force before a run.

## If the object does not exist

The answer is 404 `not_found` and nothing is charged. `reason` says which: `not_found` (it does not exist) or `private_or_deleted`.

`dataxapi setup` gives the agents on your machine (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) the DataXAPI MCP server and the base skill. The key is read from DATAXAPI_API_KEY; none is written into a file.

MCP server: `https://api.dataxapi.com/mcp`. The entry for your client is under MCP in the request examples of this page; then ask your agent to call `wechat_mp.accounts.get`.
