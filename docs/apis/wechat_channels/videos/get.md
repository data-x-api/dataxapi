## Parameters

## Returned fields

`data.item` is one post object. Stable: fields are only ever added.

Three views: `compact` (the most used fields, long text cut short), `standard` (the default: every standard field) and `full` (adds `ext`, the platform's own fields). A field is in the view named and in every larger one.

A field with no value on an item is `null`. A field this endpoint cannot give is left out and listed in `meta.unavailable`.

Typical size of one item: `compact` 561 B, `standard` 561 B, `full` 561 B (measured on the response recorded 2026-10-12 19:04 UTC).

## Paging

One object per call: there is nothing to page.

## When you are charged

| Case | Charged |
| --- | --- |
| A result with data | $0.0200, once per call |
| The object does not exist (404) | not charged |
| Invalid parameters, a failure of ours or of the data source, a timeout | not charged |
| The most one call can cost | $0.0200 (send `X-Max-Price` to refuse anything above your own limit) |

Prices as read 2026-10-18 19:59 UTC, under price book 2, in effect since 2026-10-17 11:00 UTC; the Playground reads the price in force before a run.

## If the object does not exist

The answer is 404 `not_found` and nothing is charged. `reason` says which: `not_found` (it does not exist) or `private_or_deleted`.
