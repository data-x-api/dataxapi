## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | text | Yes | Hashtag ID, a string of digits. Example: `7495235888088090635`. |

| `fields` | list of text |  | Return only these fields. Each by its path, such as `author.name`. |

## Returned fields

`data.items` is a list of post objects. Stable: fields are only ever added.

Three views: `compact` (the most used fields, long text cut short), `standard` (the default: every standard field) and `full` (adds `ext`, the platform's own fields). A field is in the view named and in every larger one.

| `approximate[].field` | text | Path of the field, such as metrics.views. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].kind` | text | Approximate, or a lower bound. Values: `approximate`, `lower_bound`. | `compact` | Yes |

A field with no value on an item is `null`. A field this endpoint cannot give is left out and listed in `meta.unavailable`.

Typical size of one item: `compact` 529 B, `standard` 773 B, `full` 773 B (measured on the response recorded 2026-10-12 18:42 UTC).

## Paging

10 items a page. The page size is the platform's; `limit` is not accepted.

For the next page pass `page.next_cursor` as `cursor`; a cursor is valid for 1 hour. `page.has_more` is false on the last page.

## When you are charged

| Case | Charged |
| --- | --- |
| A result with data | $0.0020, once per call |
| Each further page | charged as a call of its own |
| An empty result | $0.0020 |
| The object does not exist (404) | not charged |
| Invalid parameters, a failure of ours or of the data source, a timeout | not charged |
| The most one call can cost | $0.0020 (send `X-Max-Price` to refuse anything above your own limit) |

Prices as read 2026-10-18 19:59 UTC, under price book 2, in effect since 2026-10-17 11:00 UTC; the Playground reads the price in force before a run.

## If the object does not exist

The answer is 404 `not_found` and nothing is charged. `reason` says which: `not_found` (it does not exist) or `private_or_deleted`.

## Use it in your AI

`dataxapi setup` gives the agents on your machine (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) the DataXAPI MCP server and the base skill. The key is read from DATAXAPI_API_KEY; none is written into a file.

MCP server: `https://api.dataxapi.com/mcp`. The entry for your client is under MCP in the request examples of this page; then ask your agent to call `douyin.hashtags.videos.list`.
