# Douyin trend-index creator top videos API

Get the videos the platform's own index tool lists as a Douyin account's top videos for a span of up to 30 days, by the account's numeric ID: up to twenty, most liked first, each with caption, link, day published, its engagement counts and followers gained. As recorded, the tool picks from what was published on the last day or two of the span, not from all of it: set the end date to the day you want. One page; no view counts. Up to 20 items a call; $0.0020 per call. Errors and timeouts are not charged; an empty result is charged $0.0020.

The first 4 rows of a response recorded 2026-10-13 03:25 UTC.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| published_at | 2026-09-30 |
| metrics.likes | 21,725 |
| metrics.comments | 1,124 |
| metrics.shares | 145 |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | text | Yes | The account's numeric Douyin ID (uid), a string of digits; not the token starting with MS4w that the profile endpoint takes. Example: `66598046050`. |
| `since` | time | Yes | The first day counted: the China-time (UTC+8) calendar day this moment falls on. Example: `2026-09-01T00:00:00Z`. |
| `until` | time | Yes | The last day counted, read the same way; no more than 30 days after the first. Example: `2026-09-30T00:00:00Z`. |
| `view` | text |  | How much of each item to return. All three cost the same. Values: `compact`, `standard` (default), `full`. |
| `fields` | list of text |  | Return only these fields. Each by its path, such as `author.name`. |

## Returned fields

`data.items` is a list of post objects. Stable: fields are only ever added.

Three views: `compact` (the most used fields, long text cut short), `standard` (the default: every standard field) and `full` (adds `ext`, the platform's own fields). A field is in the view named and in every larger one.

| Field | Type | Description | From view | This endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | text | ID; pass it unchanged to the get endpoint. | `compact` | Yes |
| `url` | link | Link that opens the post. On this platform: The author's profile page opened on this video. | `compact` | Yes |

| `title` | text | Title. | `compact` | Not provided here |
| `text` | text | Body text. Long text: the compact view keeps the first 500 characters and says so in `warnings`. | `compact` | Yes |

| `ext.cover_url` | link | Address of the cover image. | `full` | Yes |
| `approximate` | list of object | Which numbers of this item are approximate or lower bounds; absent when all are exact. | `compact` | Yes |

| `approximate[].kind` | text | Approximate, or a lower bound. Values: `approximate`, `lower_bound`. | `compact` | Yes |

A field with no value on an item is `null`. A field this endpoint cannot give is left out and listed in `meta.unavailable`.

Typical size of one item: `compact` 451 B, `standard` 451 B, `full` 792 B (measured on the response recorded 2026-10-13 03:25 UTC).

## Paging

20 items a page. The page size is the platform's; `limit` is not accepted.

Everything comes in one page; no cursor is issued.

## When you are charged

| Case | Charged |
| --- | --- |
| A result with data | $0.0020, once per call |
| An empty result | $0.0020 |
| Invalid parameters, a failure of ours or of the data source, a timeout | not charged |
| The most one call can cost | $0.0020 (send `X-Max-Price` to refuse anything above your own limit) |

Prices as read 2026-10-18 19:59 UTC, under price book 2, in effect since 2026-10-17 11:00 UTC; the Playground reads the price in force before a run.

## If the object does not exist

An account that does not exist cannot be told from an account with no videos in the span: both return an empty result, not a 404, and are charged as an empty result is.

## Errors

Every error has the same structure: `code`, `message`, `charged`, `retry`, `retry_after_seconds`, `param`, `docs_url`.

## Use it in your AI

`dataxapi setup` gives the agents on your machine (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) the DataXAPI MCP server and the base skill. The key is read from DATAXAPI_API_KEY; none is written into a file.

MCP server: `https://api.dataxapi.com/mcp`. The entry for your client is under MCP in the request examples of this page; then ask your agent to call `douyin.index.creators.videos.list`.
