## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `board` | text |  | On this page it is fixed: `board=rising`. Which list: hot searches, rising topics, topic ranking, top search terms, the music chart. Values: `hot_search` (default), `rising`, `topics`, `searches`, `music`. Example: `rising`. |
| `cursor` | text |  | Cursor returned by the previous page. Pass `page.next_cursor` of the page before, unchanged. Each page is charged as a call of its own. |
| `view` | text |  | How much of each item to return. All three cost the same. Values: `compact`, `standard` (default), `full`. |
| `fields` | list of text |  | Return only these fields. Each by its path, such as `author.name`. |

## Returned fields

`data.items` is a list of trend objects. Stable: fields are only ever added.

Three views: `compact` (the most used fields, long text cut short), `standard` (the default: every standard field) and `full` (adds `ext`, the platform's own fields). A field is in the view named and in every larger one.

| Field | Type | Description | From view | This endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | text | The platform's ID for the entry. | `compact` | Depends on the request |
| `name` | text | Name of the entry. | `compact` | Yes |
| `rank` | integer | Position on the board, from 1; a pinned entry has none. | `compact` | Depends on the request |
| `heat` | integer | The platform's heat score. | `compact` | Yes |
| `ext.views` | integer | Total views of the related content. | `full` | Depends on the request |
| `ext.videos` | integer | Number of related videos. | `full` | Depends on the request |
| `ext.artist` | text | Who performs the song, on the music chart. | `full` | Depends on the request |
| `approximate` | list of object | Which numbers of this item are approximate or lower bounds; absent when all are exact. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].field` | text | Path of the field, such as metrics.views. | `compact` | Yes |
| `approximate[].kind` | text | Approximate, or a lower bound. Values: `approximate`, `lower_bound`. | `compact` | Yes |

A field with no value on an item is `null`. A field this endpoint cannot give is left out and listed in `meta.unavailable`.

With `board=hot_search`: `ext.artist` not returned.

With `board=rising`: `ext.views`, `ext.artist` not returned.

With `board=topics`: `ext.artist` not returned.

With `board=searches`: `id`, `rank`, `ext.views`, `ext.videos`, `ext.artist` not returned.

With `board=music`: `rank`, `ext.views`, `ext.videos` not returned.

## Paging

About 50 items a page, 51 at most. The page size is the platform's; `limit` is not accepted.

For the next page pass `page.next_cursor` as `cursor`; a cursor is valid for 1 hour. `page.has_more` is false on the last page.

With `board=hot_search`: one page, no cursor.

With `board=music`: one page, no cursor.

Answers come from a shared snapshot refreshed every 10 minutes; `meta.cached` says so and `meta.fetched_at` is when it was taken.

## When you are charged

| Case | Charged |
| --- | --- |
| A result with data | $0.0020, once per call |
| Each further page | charged as a call of its own |
| An empty result | $0.0020 |
| Invalid parameters, a failure of ours or of the data source, a timeout | not charged |
| The most one call can cost | $0.0020 (send `X-Max-Price` to refuse anything above your own limit) |

Prices as read 2026-10-18 19:59 UTC, under price book 2, in effect since 2026-10-17 11:00 UTC; the Playground reads the price in force before a run.

## Use it in your AI

`dataxapi setup` gives the agents on your machine (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) the DataXAPI MCP server and the base skill. The key is read from DATAXAPI_API_KEY; none is written into a file.

MCP server: `https://api.dataxapi.com/mcp`. The entry for your client is under MCP in the request examples of this page; then ask your agent to call `douyin.trends.list`.
